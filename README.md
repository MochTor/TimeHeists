## General info
**Time Heists** is a team based game where two teams fight each other to gain control of a point, or a flag.
Each map is set in a different time. This allows players to experience different game modes, from controlling points, to capturing points, to stealing the enemy team's flag. Every map, and consequentely every different time, has its specific heroes which the player can select from: if the map is set in the Far West, the player can select from a range of heroes which use XIXth century weapons and costumes. This way, every map has its unique gamestyle and players can experiments many different strategies.
Some _key features_ are:
* wide variety of maps, set in different world locations and different times
* wide list of map specific heroes, which have their own unique abilities
* team based experience and strategies
* low-poly graphic style

## Technologies
The game is created using entirely Unity. It uses the latest release of Unity, which is currently the 2019.2.x.
It uses different assets from the Asset Store. Some are free, others are paid versions. In particular:
* the assets used for maps and characters are developed by Synthy Studios. Since they are copyrighted and the product of many talented artists, I haven't included them in the repo.
